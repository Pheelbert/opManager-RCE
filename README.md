# opManager-RCE
Python script that utilizes opManager's "Workflow" feature to execute arbritrary commands on any managed device (Authenticated).

This script has been tested against opManager version `12.3.150`, though it should work on most versions, deeming the API hasn't been radically changed. Tests have only been done in Windows environments; I will continue testing to make sure the script works in most environments.
